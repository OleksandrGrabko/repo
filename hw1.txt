1.Most popular HVs are MS Windows Server and VmWare Esxi 
2. Esxi is monolytic hypervisor. It should be use proprietary drivers. Besides, it has a commission of performance. About 3-5%
MS Windows HV is microkernel hypervisor. It has simple partition functionality. No proprietary drivers
Teacher told me that it has most stability, but I don't agree because it is Windows!
